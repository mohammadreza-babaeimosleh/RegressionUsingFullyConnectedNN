# RegressionUsingFullyConnectedNN
implementing Linear Regression using single two-layer neural network 

## Dataset
you can download dataset from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/bike-sharing-dataset) URL 

### Note
hiddenlayer is a graphical simulator that can implement different layers of neural network for better understanding you might have some problems with it in that case, you can go to pytorch_builder.py source file and change _optimize_trace to _optimize_graph this will solve the problem or you can simply comment this part and skip it
